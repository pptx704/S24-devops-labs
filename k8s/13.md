## Implementing StatefulSet in Helm Chart

### Python App

For this, I first renamed my `deployment.yaml` to `statefulset.yaml`. Then I changed `kind` to `StatefulSet`. Then I modified `values.yaml` to include persistent volume claims for the statefulset. Changes were also made in `statefulset.yaml` to use the values from `values.yaml`.

Then I ran `--dry-run` and `--debug` to check if the changes were correct.

After everything was good, I could run `helm install`-

```bash
â‹— helm secrets install app-python ./app-python -n default -f secrets.yaml                                                                         

[helm-secrets] Decrypt: secrets.yaml
NAME: app-python
LAST DEPLOYED: Wed May  1 01:09:39 2024
NAMESPACE: default
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
NOTES:
1. Get the application URL by running these commands:
     NOTE: It may take a few minutes for the LoadBalancer IP to be available.
           You can watch the status of by running 'kubectl get --namespace default svc -w app-python'
  export SERVICE_IP=$(kubectl get svc --namespace default app-python --template "{{ range (index .status.loadBalancer.ingress 0) }}{{.}}{{ end }}")
  echo http://$SERVICE_IP:5000

[helm-secrets] Removed: secrets.yaml.dec
```

Now I could run `kubectl get`-

![kubectl get app-python](https://i.postimg.cc/43jpPNJ7/image.png)

Then I ran `minikube service`-

```bash
â‹— minikube service app-python

|-----------|------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| NAMESPACE |    NAME    | TARGET PORT |            URL            |
|-----------|------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| default   | app-python | http/5000   | http://192.168.49.2:32066 |
|-----------|------------|-------------|---------------------------|
ðŸŽ‰  Opening service default/app-python in default browser...
```

I went to the browser and visited `http://192.168.49.2:32066` a few times, and then ran `kubectl exec` to check the visits-

### Bun App (Bonus)

I did the same modifications for the `bun` app as well. Then I ran `helm install app-bun app-bun` to start the statefulset. Running `kubectl get` and `kubectl exec`, I get the following-

![kubectl get app-bun](https://i.postimg.cc/zXL8Zz5X/image.png)

![kubectl exec app-bun](https://i.postimg.cc/25Nz7Psj/image.png)

### Difference of Output

In both `app-python` and `app-bun`, different pods provided different outputs. This is because the pods maintain their own `visits.txt` file and kubernetes does its own internal load balancing. Because of the load balancing, one pod was visited more than the other and hence the difference in the output.

## Ordering Guarantee and Parallel Operations

### Explanation of not needing Ordering Guarantee

My application does not need any sort of ordering guarantee because the pods work independently of each other. Since each of them comes with their own `visits.txt` file and do not share any resource between them, there is no need to maintain a specific order. Because data consistency and sequential operations are not required, ordering guarantee is not needed.

### Implemntation of Parallel Launch and Termination

For this, I added the following to the `values.yaml` file-

```yaml
podManagementPolicy: Parallel
```

Then at the bottom of the `statefulset.yaml` file, I added the following-

```yaml
  podManagementPolicy: {{ .Values.podManagementPolicy }}
```

Rest was the same. `Parallel` pod management policy ensures that all pods are launched and terminated in parallel. In the `kubectl get po` options, the pod AGE can be inspected for confirmation.

## Update Strategies

Kubernetes provide two types of update strategies- `OnDelete` and `RollingUpdate`. The default is `RollingUpdate`.

- `RollingUpdate`: This strategy involves deleting and recreating each Pod in the StatefulSet one at a time, proceeding in order from the largest ordinal to the smallest. The control plane waits for an updated Pod to be Running and Ready before moving on to its predecessor.
- `OnDelete`: This strategy requires manual deletion of Pods to trigger the creation of new Pods reflecting modifications made to the StatefulSet's template. With this strategy, the StatefulSet controller does not automatically update the Pods; users must delete Pods to initiate the creation of new ones.
