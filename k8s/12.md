## Configmaps Volume

For this task, I needed to change `volumes` and `volumeMounts` inside `values.yaml` file. I added the following code:

```yaml
volumes:
- name: config-volume
  configMap:
    name: config

volumeMounts:
- name: config-volume
  mountPath: /app/config.json
  subPath: config.json
```

Then `templates/config.yaml` was configured to accomodate the changes. After that, running `helm install`, we could find the configmap mounted in the pod.

## Configmaps Environment

For this task, the following was added in `deployment.yaml` under `spec.containers` section-

```yaml
envFrom:
  - configMapRef:
    name: config
```

After running `helm install`, we could see the environment variables set in the pod.
